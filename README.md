# Emerald
Emerald is a Love2D framework for designing games better and faster.

# Usage
There are two ways of using Emerald:
- Clone this GitHub repository, optionally detach the repository (delete `.git`), and start using!
- Fork the repository and clone it locally, and start using!

# Why not a library?
Emerald is (planned to be) a very large framework. Having it be a library is essentially impossible as we basically overwrite most `love.*` functions, and trying to override them will break Emerald.
